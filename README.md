# Namaste React ðŸš€
# Parcel

 - Created a Dev Build
 - Created a Local server
 - HMR = Hot Module replacement(development experience so easy)
 - Parcel Uses File Watching Algorithm - Written in C++
 - Faster build because of Caching - store in parcel-cache
 - Image Optimization
 - Minification for production build
 - Bundling for production build
 - Compress
 - Consistent Hashing
 - Code Splitting
 - Differential Bundling - Support Older Browsers
 - Diagnostics
 - Error Handling
 - HTTPs
 - Tree Shaking(remove unused code => if not using all functions,classes => then remove it)
 - Transpilation
 - Different build  for Dev Bundles(takes lesser time),less optimization and Production Bundles(takes little more time, more optimization)
